# Kmeans and DBSCAN Clustering Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation and application of two popular clustering algorithms: K-Means and DBSCAN. These algorithms are used to analyze and cluster datasets to find patterns and group similar data points.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, sklearn

## Features
- Implementation of K-Means clustering algorithm.
- Implementation of DBSCAN clustering algorithm.
- Visualization of clustering results.
- Evaluation of clustering results

## How to Run the Project
1. Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed.
2. Download the project files to your local machine.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the clustering in action.
